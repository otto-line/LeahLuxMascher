            <p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-style: italic;">  2024, multi-media art installation, my graduate body of work for the Michaelis
School of Fine Art BA (Hons) degree in Fine Art, 6 December 2024, held at 31-37 Orange Street, Cape
Town.</p>
    <p>Forever Love is a multimedia installation exhibition. It expresses themes of “love” , “desire”
and “devotion” , through text works, video works, photographs and interactive installations. It
is meant to replicate a space of worship or devotion by highlighting architectural features and
honing the visualities of devotional/iconographic imagery. It uses poetics (text work) to
comment on highly personal, subjective and individual experiences – like desire, grief, love,
devotion. The show consists of a few separate works – in some, I use my body.</p>
            <p>In the performance work Necklace, I invited the public to give me hickeys. Hickey or a “love
bite” , an act of passion or “desire” . It is displaced and becomes a meditation on power,
permission, risk, and subjecthood. Inspired by the performance artist Marina Abramovic’s
Rhythm 0.</p>
<p>The installation consists of a few massive plastic images thade into plastic – through a
process called a “Tape Transfer”- a laborious practice of printing pieces of a whole picture,
covering it in sticky transparent plastic, soaking it and rubbing away the paper fibres. This was
done with over 400 A3-sized pieces of paper. The use of plastic references the materiality of
spiritual consumer goods. These goods hold an ironic tension between the sacred and the
profane.</p>
<p>Desire, devotion and love – to me, these emotions hold similar tensions; they can be cruel,
beautiful, consuming, but also sacred. Forever Love seeks to express emotively, transport
and affect the viewer.</p>
<p> Forever Love is hot fiery sadness, cellophane wrapped, and price tagged.</p>
