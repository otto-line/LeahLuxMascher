    <p>Queerness is given form by practice, rather than by design. It does not possess a blueprint or design in the
same sense that architectural space does. Architectural structures tend to impose themselves upon
(sexed) bodies, while queerness – as a technology, event or undertaking – offers the possibility of rebellion,
repudiation, and subversion. This collation of works invites the viewer to consider the relationship
between architecture and queerness. What happens when the two encounter one another? That is, when
queerness happens to a concretised, unyielding environment. Can architectural space be appropriated
and utilized to imagine some sense of a personal identity and belonging into tangible reality? If and where
not, how does queerness – in its all its ambivalence, devotionality and innovativeness – work to undermine
the imperiousness of the built world?</p>
            <p>Participants: Bjorn Thomas, Matthew Michael, Unathi Mkonto.</p>
