        <div class="project-description"> <p style="text-transform: uppercase; font-style: italic;"> NECKLACE is a live interactive performance piece and installation, held at "Demo Projects" , on the 6th of
June 2024, at 79 Roeland Street, in Cape Town. Inspired by Marina Abramovic's "Rhythm 0" (1974).</p> 
    <p>
    I needed a necklace for a night out - and invited the public to place "hickeys" on my neck. Hickeys or "love
    bites" are seen as a display of sexuality and promiscuity. Yet also a shameful mark to be hidden after a
    passionate act. It is a symbol of "cheap" lust, and usually on the neck of a woman.
    </p> <p> Necklace is an experiment in permission and boundaries.
No text had preceded or been made available at the show. The only text was handwritten "instructions" on
the wall.</p>
<p> <I>1. Sanitise an area on my neck <br>
2. Place your lips <br>
3. Give me a hickey</I></p>
<p>The audience became part of the meaning-making process, by participating or not. Within thinking about
boundaries, permission, conversations around desire, consent, connection, loneliness and gender
followed.</p> 
<p>I chose to avoid eye contact and verbal engagement with the audience. It was uncomfortable and meant to
be so. The space was bare, most people avoided moving too close to where I was seated, and some avoided
looking entirely - opting for peering in from outside.
Some hickeys felt forceful and rushed. It was a challenge, and they wanted to step up and display their
courage. Others were awkward and doubted their performance. One became so flustered that they littered
the set with the alcohol swab and its wrapper, and one spilt beer. There were a few quiet ones, they felt
soft, open and like a genuine exchange.</p>
<p>I've had a few conversations afterwards. Some were quite vulgar and revealing. Others were tearful and
upset - they felt triggered by the performance and were reminded of times they felt taken advantage of. A
woman felt that if their older male partner were to participate, she would view him as taking advantage of
younger women. My mother said the performance exuded loneliness.
My ultimate takeaway was - I was reminded of my/ the art community, those who came to Demo, were
people who loved and lived art.</p>
<br> 
<br> Thank you!
Love Lux xx</div>
